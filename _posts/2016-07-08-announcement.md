## While our packs may have been different in style, We have always shared the same goal. 
To bring high quality packs to the AT Launcher. In which we will continue to do so together! In the future our website will be forwarded to a new section on -[Their Site](http://www.resonant-rise.com/) in which all of Beyond Reality News will be posted and discussed. Beyond Reality will not cease to exist but will fall under the Resonant rise orgnaization and will hereby be known as. 
####ResonantRise:Beyond Reality 
####ResonantRise:Divergence.

### From the Resonant Rise Team.

> Today we are here to bring you news on an exciting development and opportunity for the pack team and in general for the community at large. Today we are excited to announce that the Resonant Rise family is expanding its arms to two new partners we’ll be working closely with under the Resonant Rise Name.
 I want to start off by saying that with the merger all parties have agreed to work closely together to produce high-quality packs and to help further the growth of our collective communities, while still keeping our own independence as pack teams. Meaning that we will work together to help each other produce high quality packs but each team will still has their own creative freedom, free from any outside pressures or interferences. This is so Resonant Rise can still produce their own brand of high-quality kitchen-sink packs as usual while Beyond Reality (more info below) can continue to produce their brand of high quality intricate mod packs.
 Starting off, since we mentioned it above, we have the wonderful Beyond Reality Team who’ve brought you high-quality and intricate packs such as Beyond Reality and Beyond Reality: Divergence. We’ve been in close talks with their development team and both they and us have expressed interest in merging our two organizations for the purpose of producing more high-quality packs for the ATL Launcher and for the collective communities at large. 
 The second partner we’re including in our family is a single person but nonetheless his resumé is nothing to laugh at. We are excited to announce the inclusion of Sir Gideon Seymour to our mod pack family. Gideon Seymour has made several cool packs under his time on the FTB team which he’s no longer affiliated with. He’s made packs such as Phoenix Reborn, Pathfinder, Running Red and many more. We are indeed very happy to have the likes of him joining our creative family and we hope that together we can create some truly kick-ass mod packs.
 Together, Resonant Rise, Beyond Reality, and Gideon will be working towards the single purpose of creating more kick-ass mod packs and experiences for our community members as well as for everyone out there in general! In the future, this family might expand further, and once it does we’ll inform everyone about it, but for now this is all the news we have to give you!
